FORMAL PSEUDOCODE:
CLEAR console
PRINT Welcome user, explanation of app
WHILE keep going
    GET loan amount in $
    GET loan duration in years and months
        SET user_years - loan in years
        SET user_months - loan in months
    GET APR as a percentage %

    SET monthly_interest_rate to:
        SUBPROCESS: Calculate monthly interest rate (APR / 12)

    SET total_duration_months to:
        SUBPROCESS: Calculate loan duration in months (user_years * 12 ) + user_months

    SET monthly_payment to:
        SUBPROCESS: Calculate monthly payment rate: m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))
        m = monthly payments
        p = loan amount
        j = monthly interest rate
        n = duration in months

    DISPLAY the resulting monthly payment
    GET user input to use app again
