# Given a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], mutate the list by removing the
# number at index 2, so that the list becomes [1, 2, 4, 5].

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# my_list.pop(2)

# my_list.remove(my_list[2])


#LS Solution:
del my_list[2]
# Del can be used to delete elements from a list, a key-value pair from a 
# dictionary, a variable from memory or entire lists/dictionaries

print(my_list)
